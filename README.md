# Assertive

[![Go Reference](https://pkg.go.dev/badge/github.com/teleivo/assertive.svg)](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/teleivo/assertive)

Assertive is an assertion library for writing tests in Go.

It only has one dependency on https://github.com/google/go-cmp.

## Install

```sh
go get -u github.com/teleivo/assertive
```

## Disclaimer

I wrote this library for my personal projects. It is thus tailored to my style of writing tests. I
do try to stick to https://go.dev/wiki/CodeReviewComments#useful-test-failures. Feel free to use
it! That being said, my intention is not to adjust it to someone elses liking.
