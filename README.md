# Assertive

Assertive is an assertion library for writing tests in Go.

## Disclaimer

I wrote this library for my personal projects. It is thus tailored to my style of writing tests. I
do try to stick to https://go.dev/wiki/CodeReviewComments#useful-test-failures. Feel free to use
it! That being said, my intention is not to adjust it to someone elses liking.
